Our Program is a fun tic-tac-toe game where there are no winners or losers!

In our program we use an enum class called SquareType with our 3 characters (X/O/Empty).
Our board is a struct made of a SquareType 2d array and a row and col int.

To run the program input this commmand into terminal:
g++ -std=c++11 TicTacToe.cpp -o play
./play

To play the game insert the row and column when prompted.
